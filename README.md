# Project Proposal - Can we predict the success of a movie? 

For this project, we are hoping to discover what factors create popular movies. We want to achieve this by answering questions based on our combined interests in the dataset. 
 
Let's explore and ask the data what information it holds. 

# Group 6: YAY Team!

# Overview
In this repository we will store all relevant project documents. We will use Jupyter Notebooks for processing, clean up, analyzing and visualizations. We found the 5000-movie database and according to TMDB the “movies are query-able by fields like average rating, certifications, release dates and genres.”  Other categories such as spoken language, popularity, and title will help us to identify the data and answer our questions. 

Sources utilized for data, articles, and topic research:
   - https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
   - https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
   - https://github.com/datadesk/cpi

## Workflow:
We will dive the workflow so as to fairly distribute the work between members of Group 6. We start by assigning the main task of coding the data cleanse to one person as the group participates in research and troubleshooting. We then divide up our brainstormed questions and each member has at least one question to answer (depending on other task assignments like cleaning data and managing project documents on GitHub). By using the skills we have learned to date we will compare various characteristics that make a movie popular and hopefully create a set of conclusions and variables to predict the success of a movie.

Para-project Tasks:
   - Data Wrangling : Ally 
   - GitHub : Anastasia

Initial Discovery Questions:
   - What characteristics do popular movies have in common? (linear regression?) - Team
   - What’s the trend between decades and movie genre? -Grace
   - Comparison of popularity by geography? - Anastasia
   - How does budget correlate with popularity? - Kellie
   - Linear regression on popularity in production cost? - Masita
   - Decades and blockbuster success: is it cyclical? Is there genre resurgence? - Kellie
   - Correlation between runtime and popularity? - Grace
   - Relationship between genre and rating? - Masita
   - Correlation between the length of titles and voter rating? - Ally
